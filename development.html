            <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>September:</strong> Focused on creating the overall design and layout of the website. This was an important first step in understanding the user experience (UX) and establishing a solid foundation for the frontend. I began by mapping out key features and visual elements such as the navigation bar and the user login system.</li>
                
                <li><strong>October:</strong> Transitioned into backend development, which involved setting up and configuring Supabase for user authentication, using Render for API hosting, and Node.js with Express for handling server-side functionality. This phase was crucial because it connected the frontend with the database, allowing the app to track user progress, save workout data, and manage user sessions.</li>

                <li><strong>November - December:</strong> Introduced new, impactful features to enhance the user experience. The nutrition tracker was added, allowing users to log and track their meals and calories. This feature was designed with both aesthetics and functionality in mind, providing an easy-to-use interface while offering detailed insights into nutritional habits. Additionally, I integrated an AI chatbot to guide users with fitness advice, recommendations, and progress tracking. The chatbot leveraged natural language processing to provide relevant responses and tips based on user input, helping make the fitness journey more interactive and personalized.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Mentor's Role</h3>
            <p>Throughout this journey, my mentor was a crucial support system, especially when I encountered issues with the backend development. Their guidance helped me navigate the intricacies of API integration and database management. Without their advice, I would have struggled with certain coding challenges, and I am grateful for their continued support as I advanced through this process.</p>
